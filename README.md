# Credit Card Fraud Detection – Finex (IIITB upGrad Capstone)

## Business Context
Finex is facing significant revenue losses due to rising fraudulent credit and debit card transactions.
This project builds a machine learning–based fraud detection system to identify fraudulent transactions
and reduce financial losses.

## Dataset
- Simulated credit card transaction dataset
- ~1.85 million transactions
- Fraud rate ~0.52% (highly imbalanced)

## Project Approach
1. Structured problem solving and root cause analysis
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature engineering and skewness handling
4. Imbalanced data treatment
5. Model building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
6. Model evaluation using Recall, Precision, ROC-AUC
7. Cost–Benefit Analysis
